## Debugging Tasks

Below are the issues and improvements identified for the project:

1. **Remove Interfaces Placement**
    - Eliminate interfaces that are incorrectly placed between the `@Component` decorator and the TypeScript class in `app.component.ts`.

2. **Semicolon Usage**
    - Remove unnecessary semicolons after the `@Component` decorator in both `app.component.ts` and `ad-to-cart.component.ts`.

3. **Component Imports**
    - Ensure the `AddToCartComponent` is included in the `imports` array within `app.component.ts`.

4. **Cart Quantity Validation**
    - Enforce a minimum item quantity of 1 when adding products to the cart.
